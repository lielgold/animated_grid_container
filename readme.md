# AnimatedGridContainerPlugin (Godot 4 Port)

This is a Godot 4.4.1 port of the [AnimatedGridContainerPlugin](https://github.com/gmarais/AnimatedGridContainerPlugin) by [gmarais](https://github.com/gmarais).
It provides a more flexible `GridContainer` node that can fill its children from top to bottom and left to right.  
Animations are supported as well. 
It's not an actual plugin because that would be too much work for a single gd script: animated_grid_container.gd. That's all you need.
